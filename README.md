# Touchscreen-Chamber

This repository contains information about a open-source touchscreen chamber for operant conditioning. 
Here, we want to share all relevant information about the touchscreen chamber used in the publication "A flexible python-based touchscreen chamber for operant conditioning reveals improved visual perception of cardinal orientations in mice" by Wiesbrock et al. 2022 (Link). 

Parts of the scripts are based on the Psychopy-Toolkit by Jonathan Peirce (https://www.psychopy.org/)


# Overview

Operant conditioning is crucial technique to quantatitate the perception of animals. We propose this touchscreen chamber to support open science and reproducibility. 
The scripts can be adapted to different experimental situations. For now, we propose pretraining procedures, so the animals can familarize themselves with the touchscreen chamber. Then there are three different approaches presented: Visual discrimination between different orientateted sine-wave gratings, a newly developed parallel visual discrimination test and, also new in the field of the mouse visual system, a staircase procedure with an adapting level of difficulty.
