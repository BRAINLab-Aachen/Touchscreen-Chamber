# Touchscreen-Chamber

This repository contains information about a open-source touchscreen chamber for operant conditioning. 
Here, we want to share all relevant information about the touchscreen chamber used in the publication "XXXXXXXXX" by Wiesbrock et al. 2022 (Link). 

Parts of the scripts are based on the Psychopy-Toolkit by Jonathan Peirce (https://www.psychopy.org/)

Operant conditioning is crucial technique to quantatitate the perception of animals. We propose this touchscreen chamber to support open science and reproducibility. 
The scripts can be adapted to different experimental situations
